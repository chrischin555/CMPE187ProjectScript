# CMPE187ProjectScript

Script for Dr. Gao's CMPE 187 class. This script automates Google Gemini's API to process an image and an input from a CSV file. More specifically, the Python program automates the test cases for all four test partitions. A Flask application serves as the front-end to display the results.
